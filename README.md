# What is this

I am sick of scammers. This extension is meant to protect you against scams. This was designed with CS scams in mind but it is effective against any scams where the scammer tries to get you to log in on a fake steam page to retrieve your login information.

The extension simply checks every page that you are visiting to see if it is a known scam website or if it is a website that is posing as a steam loging page while not being the official stean login page. :warning: Don't actually use this extension just yet as right now it doesn't actually do anything as it is still in development.

# Development

[August 6th] : the extension is ready to display warning when visiting a fraudulent page. All that is missing is the algorithm to detect such websites (:warning: Therefore, do not use it as it is not detecting anything at the moment...)

# Future development
